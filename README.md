# Auth Dashboard

![Dashboard Screenshot](./auth-dashboard-react.png)

This is the second iteration of the auth / accounts dashboard. For non-admin users this looks pretty much the same as always but the for admins it now allows to edit other users, generate register tokens and much more. This was previously only possible via APIs, the dashboard capabilities just weren't there yet. This new dashboard changes this.

Instead of using plain javascript this frontend is now powered by react.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
